#APMRabbit

The following application is a Android version of APMRabbit. This project is currently in development. What makes this project
really cool, is that you can control the GoPro and APM Rover in the same application. The GoPro uses the WiFi adpater of your
Android device, and the USB on the go is used to control the 3DR Transmitter. The 3DR Transmitter will display current up-to-date
information about the rover and changing modes will come into effect as well

##Requirements for Android

Here is a list of what needs to be there for this to work.

1. GoPro Hero 2 or newer model
2. Android 4.2 or greater
