APMRabbit is software created for the APMRover Project located (http://rover.ardupilot.com/). APMRabbit was created by Students for their final project. APMRabbit has two main applications, an viewing application called RabbitEye. RabbitEye uses the GoPro Hero 3+ camera to stream, shoot video and take pictures. RabbitController uses the APM communicator to control the rover in any direction it wants.
